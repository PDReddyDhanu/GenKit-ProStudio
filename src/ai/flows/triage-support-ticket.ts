Analyze the following ticket and determine its category and priority. Then, craft a suggested first response for the admin/faculty to send.

**Ticket Details:**
- **From:** {{{studentName}}}
- **Subject:** {{{subject}}}
- **Question:** {{{question}}}

**Categorization Rules:**
- **Technical Issue:** Problems with the website, submission errors, login issues.
- **Approval Question:** Questions about the project approval workflow, status, or deadlines.
- **Team Dispute:** Inter-personal problems within a team. These are always HIGH priority.
- **Evaluation Question:** Questions or disputes about how a project was scored or evaluated.
- **General Inquiry:** Anything that doesn't fit into the other categories.

Based on this, provide the category, priority, and a suggested response in the required JSON format. The response should be empathetic and reassuring.`,
